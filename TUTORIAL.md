# Playing the game

* To start a new game, open the game page and click on "Start new game".
* The game will provide a wallet address so you can make the payment.
* Copy the highlighted address and use your Sphere wallet to transfer the indicated amount to the Game Wallet
* Provide your wallet address and click on "Check Payment". (This step usually takes just a few minutes, but in some instances, it took me hours.)
* The game will automatically start when the transaction gets published to the blockchain.
* After the Game shows up, press "1" to start. "Q" moves your paddle UP and "A" moves your paddle DOWN.
* If you win, you will have the option to redeem the prize. Provide the address to withdraw your ZEN.
